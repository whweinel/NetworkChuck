Program eldenring.sh will let you play Elden Ring in Bash! The program begins by letting you choose what class you'd like to be, after choosing a class you will go on to fight your first beast by picking a number 0 or 1. If you lose it will exit and you will have to start over but if you win you will go on to your final battle. The final battle is harder and you will have to choose a random number 0-9 to beat Margit. There is a cheat code though to help you win by typing coffee if you don't want to guess a number.
